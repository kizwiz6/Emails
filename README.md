# FORM A STORY

## Form Creation

- This project involves creating a form to collect user input for a story using a GET request to story.html.
- The form will include various input elements such as text inputs, radio buttons, and a dropdown list.
- Each input element should have appropriate labels and attributes like id, name, type, and required.
- The form should have a submit button labeled "Form My Story!" at the bottom.
## User Input
- The story requires information about animals, adjectives, verbs, numbers, yes/no answers, and a relative speed.
## Datalist for Motivational Quotes
- A datalist element will be used to provide users with quote options while also allowing them to input their own custom quote.
- To set up the <datalist>, add a <label> with a for attribute of "quote" and the text "Motivational Quote:".
- After the <label>, add an <input> with an id and name of "quote", type set to "text", required attribute, and list attribute of "quote-choices".
- Add the <datalist> under the <input> element with an id of "quote-choices".
- Add a few <option>s with values within the <datalist> element.
## Meaningful Message
- Add a <label> with a for attribute of "message" and the text "Meaningful Message:" on the web page.
- Under the <label>, add a <textarea> with an id and name of "message", required attribute, 8 rows, and 40 columns.
- Add a line break after the <textarea> element.
